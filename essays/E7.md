<h2>Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <h5>Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context:</h5>
      <p>
        When we do labs in this class we learn basic programming skills in an IT context. Not only that we also have to look at the user manual to understand what each code does. Some modules that really helped with that are "variables and data," "Expressions and Operators, and so on till the end of the semester, so I should say all the modules helped.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge:</h5>
      <p>
        During our lectures we went over how some codes are used in programming, which we used in our labs to undergo more understanding of what those code do. This then lead to algoritmic thinking. Undertanding basic programming skills and knowledge helped us to thinka algorithmicly, especially when we practice the day of week lab and wod to practice algorithmic thinking.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications:</h5>
      <p>
        I really got hands on experience when we removed the training wheels (screencasts) for the WODS. I felt that this made me more hands on is that I did not have a scrrencast to refer to when I had problems with my code. To add on, when we started doing the Assignments, we really were hands on because we had to change the template to our own. We used CSS, html, and javascript to make a working E-commerce, calculating day of the week, and making change. We developed algorithmic thinking doing so. 
      </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions:</h5>
      <p>
        During this class we have come across many probelms and first-hand had to solve them. In our class we had a discord where students can say what they were, and I sometimes try and help other students with their problems, and sometimes the error is very minimal like a mispelled word. We also experienced launching the Assignment #1 into google cloud, which was a bit complicated at first, but later figured out what we needed to do to work. We see a lot of errors in MIS, but we shall not give up if a problem ever come up, there is always a way if we put our mind to it.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues:</h5>
      <p>
        We expereinced and understand first-hand project management and software development issues more in the Assinments. The reason was because in the Assignments we needed to complete multiple tasks especially in Assignment #2 where there was login, registration, invoice, and our own IR. We needed to manage that and make sure all the tasks were complete.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li> 
    <h5>Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems:</h5>
      <p>
        After many practices with WODS and Labs, we gained more confidence in our code, although it sometimes may be confusing we were able to create an E-commerce website in Assignment #1 and improved it more in Assignment #2. When we got to the Assignments we were able to understand more why things we not working, and knowing where to solve it or know where to start to look. In Assignment #2 and the lab cookies and session, we got to understand security problems and how to store data securely.
