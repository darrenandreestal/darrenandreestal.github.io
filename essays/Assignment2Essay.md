<h2> Overall Reflection</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html" target="_blank">Assignment2</a> we had to build off our Assignment2, but the main issue is transering the quantities from the store page to the invoice. The reason why this is the main issue or problem to solve is that before we get into the log in page, we have to redirect them to a log in page, which the quantities data could get lost after we press login because it is a new form. Also the quantities data needs to be transfered to the registration page when the user needs to register, and then transferred to the invoice after successfully registering. Here is my Assignment2,<a href="https://assignment2-421719.wl.r.appspot.com" target="_blank">The Prints</a>, yes there is still a few bugs. </p>

<h4>What did you learn from this assignment?</h4>
<p>I learned that it is important to have sessions and cookies to make this whole process easier. The reason why I say that is because it is very tedious to keep storing the quantities data over and over again after every time the user clicks on a link.</p>

<h4>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).</h4>
<p>I did not work with a partner.</p>

<h4>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?</h4>
<p>I got help from various ways; intructur, teacher assistant, classmates, and chatGPT. The help I recieved from my instructur was just a small error where I did not add a "?" in a res.redirect to login.html, with this help I had a better understanding with why "?" is important to add when adding the quering string at the end of the URL. Lui, the TA, helped me with an error that was not populating the invoice after successfully logging in, there was a part of code in the invoice that redifined quantities that was making this error, we jsut needed to delete it to make it work. My classmates jsut allowed me to understand what I needed to do for this assignment. ChatGPT helped me with small errors like the one my instructur helped me with. </p>

<h4>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?</h4>
<p>This is different from Assignment #1 because this Assignment 1 had only one form that directed you to the invoice right awat. Assignment #2 needed you to have multiple forms in different pages, which needed you to keep the information typed in from the different forms while you switch pages.</p>

<h4>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(a) 30% 24/7: I was always thinking about how I will do something (not including debugging)</li>
  <li>(b) 20%</li>
  <li>(c) 50%: There is always something wrong, which is why if I were to combine (a) and (c) it would be 100% because I was always thinking about how to fix something.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?</h4>
<p>What worked well for me was understanding how the whole website works. With this this allowed me to know where code needed to be added or replaced. I was successful with transferring the data quantities to the invoice. I also successfully incorporated the IR5, which was to personalize the pages after successfully logging in, although my practice may be poor method of doing it because there was a lot of redundant code, when I could have just made one function for it, but I did not and that is okay. What messed up my code was erroring messages. I felt I had to most struggle with erroring. I am still not quite sure what happened with that but I did my erroring message on the html with a js.</p>

<h4>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?</h4>
<p>If I could go back and do things differently, I wish I learned more about how the errors worked on the template of Assignment #1, so I could be better prepared for Assignment #2. Also I think I spent a lot of time with adding code that was redunant, I wish I could have made a function to replace that, becuase I used the same code multiple times for the different pages.</p>
