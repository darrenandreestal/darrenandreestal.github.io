<h2> Overall Reflection</h2>
<p>
  Assignment 1 was a cumulative of things inputted together from this semester implementing code to make a dynamic website with products to purchase and calculate the total in an invoice. In my website I had to implement <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/130.Assignment1/experience-Assignment1.html">IR1</a>, which was to track the total quantity of each item sold. I had many struggles, some successes to work this website out, and some things that did not quite go right.
</p>

<h3>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h3>
<p>
  Reading <b>The Manual</b> using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> helped me understand the basic things about the code and what they do, and their potential ways it could be used. 
</p>

<p>
  Using <b>ChatGPT</b> is another way I improved my skills. I do not depend or copy exactly from Chat, but it does tell me what I did wrong in my code and what I can fix up. Examples of this is when I was trying to fix up my invoice because I wanted to add a line above the total, I asked Chat what I could do in css to style this, Chat showed me to a way to do it. From this it allowed me to see how to format the border of the last row of a table, since the invoice is in a table. Chat showed some unnecesary things, which I did not use. I definetly think AI is very powerful to help us improve because it does not just show us a way, but it explains to you what each part of the code do, to an extent, if you ask it.
</p>

<p>
  Watching <b>screencasts</b> has helped me tremendously to improve my skills because it allowed me to see how each code works and not just reading about it. I feel that this has helped me a lot because I could rewind or find my way back to a part of lecture I could not quite understand for the first time. 
</p>

<p>
  All of <b>past WODs and Labs</b> has helped me understand most of the things that we learned this semester. Doing the WODs allowed me to implement what we learned in our labs, and it just a great way for me to practice.
</p>

<h4>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h4>
<p>
  I need to start earlier on my WODs and Assignments because it will allow me to process what I need to do or know before doing them. I think starting earlier will help me because with each WODs and Assignments there needs to be time for prepping and refletion on specific skills needed to complete the work. 
</p>

<h4>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h4>
<p>
  This is true to some extent because I did learn a lot from the WODs and I do them without watching the screencast until I am truly stuck. I watch the screencast to know where I went wrong. There was this one time the WODs said to use the store1 file, but we had store1 from lab and there was one from the Lab. This confused my code so much because the instructions were saying something but the file that I had either had too many of something else or missing something else because it was not the correct file I was using. So when I watched the screencast, it fixed a part of my problem. There were a lot of times where I had to cry it out to actually finish the WODs because it was not working.
</p>

<h4>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h4>
<p>
  Again, I beleive this to be true to some extent. I think the lab is set up to understand a few things, but most of the things we have to look at the manual. I do understand that there is a lot to cover for each lab, but I feel that we miss some points sometimes. The "do-on-your-own" troubles me because sometimes we did not go over them or how to do them, and we are completely on our own, and I thought this class was for people with no or little experience with coding.
</p>

<h4>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h4>

<p>
  This is true because we have almost everything. For me I now understand the template we used to finish Assignment 1, and if I know how it works, it should be moderate dificulty to do Assignment 2. For example I know which code is in use when the user pushes the purchases button. Which is one thing we will need because for Assignment 2 we are required to have the user log in or sign up when they purchase. 
</p>

<h4>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h4>

<p>
  I think this class could improve in the lectures. I feel that the instructor sometimes goes off topic or focuses too much on one topic that we do not have time to go over the other topics. Although sometimes the information are important, most were being repetetive.
</p>

<h4>What helps me the most in class are:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Screencasts</li>
  <li>Working with classmates</li>
  <li>One-on-one help</li>
  <li>ChatGPT</li>
</ul>
