<h3>Introduction</h3>
I am Darren Andre Estal majoring in Management Information System and Human Resources. I am a second year in Shidler College of Business and I want to graduate with a Bachelor's degree (I am however deciding if I should do a graduates program). I find myself around so many technologies, especially since I do game a lot, but before that I use to do a lot of editing because I used to do photography. That brings me to why I am surrounded with computers today.

<h3>Why did I choose MIS?</h3>
I chose MIS because I want to be the ones solving the problems and suggesting edits. I am actually quit unsure why, but I just want to earn the skills of Information Systems. Some skills that I want to learn are coding and adapting to different systems. I am very interested in learning different ways of solving an issue  in the business aspect.

<h3>Why do I want to double major in Human Resources?</h3>
I feel that in a way MIS has a role in how employees work. When employers hire, they can look at data and make sense of it to know what type of people, where, when to hire. I feel that information is very powerful in making a company run successfully.
