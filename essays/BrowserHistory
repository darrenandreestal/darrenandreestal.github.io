<h3>Overall Experience</h3>
I feel like a bit rusty with html and css that doing these exercises is such good practice. I feel that one of the most challenging but rewarding part is narrating my steps. I stumbled my words or sometimes did not know the terms were, which was difficult because you have to focus on what you are doing, as well as knowing what to say. Narratting was rewarding because it allowed me to explain what I am doing, which makes me feel like I know what I am doing. I also feel that narrating was helpful because I soft-parent myself, which made me more focused on what I was doing.

<h3>Browser History 1</h3>
For browser history 1, I ended up with a time of 14 minutes which is within the Rx time. I felt that this took the longest time because we had to set everything up. However, I felt that this was the easiest one. The reason why I say thta is that the formatting is very minimal and we were just copy and pasting everything onto the html. I did this a few times because on my first take I had only one paragraph tag for each section which combined two paragraph into one, so I restarted. When I completed this on my own, I realized I had done something wrong, which was the Table of Contents. In the table of contents I made the links to other website, however after watching the screencast we were suppose to link the table of content to their specific sections. I did not do that before so the video was helpful. Overall, I felt Browser History 1 was easy.

<h3>Browser History 2</h3>
My attept in Browser History 2 ended up with a time of 9:17, which is in the Rx time. I have worked with CSS before and I love to see how the formatting chnages the display in so many ways. I think this was an easy exercise, with the main problem of mispelling or mistyping things in the css.

<h3>Browser History 3</h3>
Browser History 3 was a challenge for me doing it on my own. I feel that I had a bad habit of putting things into a table to align them in columns. So when I first did it without the video, I tried doing it using a table tag, and it worked but it took too long. For this I landed on Av time, not sure of the time since I restarted, but for my final attempt I timed at 8 minutes in the Rx time. I did 4 attempts, one was on my own, the second was after watching the video, and the third was with mispelling. After watching the video I tried it again and had minor mistakes, instead of width I put margin, and instead of ".center" I did "center" which were all minor mistakes. I think the biggest challenge is that css has so many attributes that if you are doing this on your own you have to know or experiment on each of the attributes to see how they display the html.
