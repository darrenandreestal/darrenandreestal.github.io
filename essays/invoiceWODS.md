<h3> Invoice 1 Overview</h3>
<p>For this WOD we created a sales receipt for a sale that contains five different products. We made sure that the things on the receipt were not hard coded into the file. <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">Click here</a> for further information about the WOD and <a href="https://github.com/darrenandreestal/ITM352_S24_repo/blob/71f08219e8144cb632485751e83e1e70aa8a0f62/WODs/Invoice1/invoice.html">click here</a> for my WOD page.</p>


<h3> My experience performing Invoice1</h3>
<p>I think this WODS was one of my favorites because we used algebra and I am a math girly (BASIC MATH). Performing this WOD however was a bit repetitive, which I think was good so I experience muscle memory. I struggled mostly with quotations, I got to the part of document.write () and I forgot about adding the backticks, and I was 25 minutes in and I could not find why my items were not showing up in the table. I think I also stumbled upon what I had to multiply or add up, I knew what I was doing, but after the second try after midnight things start to not make sense. Overall, I did 3 tries and ended off with 25 minutes.</p>

<p>In all my WODS, I like to prepare by reading all the instructions first to know what kind of things I will be facing. This helps me to see the different sections of the tasks and so I do not skip or repeat steps. I think for this WODS we did mostly to learn to not hardcode things to the file, whereas in the past WODS we hard coded information. For the next WOD I think I can better prepare by rereading a few materials from the class.</p>
